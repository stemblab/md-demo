# blab title

Ordinary dollar signs must be escaped  \$. 

Per GFM, these characters must be escaped:
\`,\*,\_,\{,\},\[,\],\(,\),\#,\+,\-,\.,\!

Another dollar sign: \$. [\int x dx \$ is not treated as mathjax]).

Inline math on one line: $x=y$ and $a=b$.

Displayed equation:
$$ u_t+uu_x+u_{xxx} = 0.$$1234567890
A\*B (escaped \*)
$$ 
u_t+uu_x+u_{xxx} = \frac{a*b}{c}. 
$$ 
Some text, then inline: $x_n=b_m$.

Some text, then inline: $x=c$.

As code:

```
$$ \pi^2 / e $$
```

and another


` $u_t+u_x = 0$ `




This is an inline equation that is split over lines $a = b = c = d = e
= f = g * h = i = j = k * l$


The example below requires just 5 lines of new code (and editing a few lines of
auto-generated code). Follow along and, in just a few moments, you can use this
blab as a template for your own work. Let's start with some math:

$$z(\theta;k)=x+iy=\exp(it)-\frac{1}{2}\exp(ikt)+\frac{1}{3}\exp(-i14t)$$

The parameter $k*t$ is set by the slider, and the plot shows the real and imaginary
parts of $z*1$ as $t*2$ is swept. The table shows powers of $k$.

Code to control the layout is auto-generated. You can show, then edit,
this code by clicking the slider (label), plot, or table.

To create your own blab, edit any code and click the "Save" button that appears
in the upper right. Blabs are saved to GitHub gists. You can save anonymously
(but each time you save you'll get a new gist ID), or to your GitHub account
(using a token).

You can edit this text by clicking anywhere on it (the source is
GitHub Flavored Markdown).
